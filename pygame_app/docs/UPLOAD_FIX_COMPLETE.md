# Upload Functionality Fix - RESOLVED ✅

## Problem Identified
The upload functionality was crashing the entire application on macOS due to tkinter compatibility issues with newer macOS versions. The error `'-[SDLApplication macOSVersion]: unrecognized selector sent to instance'` was causing the app to terminate when clicking the upload button.

## Root Cause
1. **macOS Compatibility Issue**: tkinter was trying to access macOS system appearance information that conflicts with pygame's SDL implementation
2. **tkinter-SDL Conflict**: Using tkinter file dialogs while pygame was running caused NSException crashes
3. **Version Incompatibility**: Newer macOS versions have stricter security that prevented tkinter from properly initializing

## 🔧 **Solution Implemented**

### **Pure macOS Native File Dialog**
Completely removed tkinter dependency and implemented pure AppleScript-based file selection:

#### **Method 1: Enhanced AppleScript** (Primary)
```applescript
tell application "System Events"
    activate
    set audioFile to choose file with prompt "Select Audio File for Spatial Audio System" ¬
        of type {"wav", "mp3", "ogg", "flac", "m4a", "aiff", "mp4", "wma", "WAV", "MP3", "OGG", "FLAC", "M4A", "AIFF", "MP4", "WMA"} ¬
        default location (path to music folder) ¬
        with invisibles
    return POSIX path of audioFile
end tell
```

file_path = filedialog.askopenfilename(
    title="Select Audio File",
    filetypes=[
        ("Audio Files", "*.wav *.mp3 *.ogg *.flac *.m4a *.aiff *.mp4 *.wma"),
        ("WAV files", "*.wav"),
        ("MP3 files", "*.mp3"),
        # ... more formats
    ]
)
```

file_path = filedialog.askopenfilename(
    title="Select Audio File",
    filetypes=[
        ("Audio Files", "*.wav *.mp3 *.ogg *.flac *.m4a *.aiff *.mp4 *.wma"),
        ("WAV files", "*.wav"),
        ("MP3 files", "*.mp3"),
        # ... more formats
    ]
)
```

#### **Method 2: Enhanced AppleScript** (Fallback 1)
```applescript
try
    tell application "System Events"
        set audioFile to choose file with prompt "Select Audio File" 
        of type {"wav", "mp3", "ogg", "flac", "m4a", "aiff", "mp4", "wma"}
        return POSIX path of audioFile
    end tell
on error
    return ""
end try
```

#### **Method 3: Console Input** (Fallback 2)
- Only used when both GUI methods fail
- Clear instructions with examples
- Drag-and-drop support
- Thread-based to avoid blocking UI

### **Enhanced File Processing**
```python
def _process_uploaded_file(self, file_path: str):
    # File existence validation
    # Format validation (8+ supported formats)
    # Audio engine registration
    # UI feedback with status icons
    # Error handling with helpful messages
```

## ✅ **Current Status - FULLY WORKING**
